# TypeScript Type Error with Array and String

This example demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript that occurs when passing an array to a function expecting a string argument.

## Problem
The `greeter` function expects a single string as input. Attempting to pass an array results in a type error.

## Solution
The solution involves either changing the function signature to accept an array or modifying the function body to handle array inputs appropriately.
